        <p>Implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme#Coin_flipping" target="blank">coin flipping</a>
        algorithm where the 'commitment' is handled by encrypting the guess and then after the result of the flip is determined 
        the key is provided to 'prove' that the guess didn't change after the outcome was known.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate open the link with a friend (or in a second window) and pass the connection Id to 'connect' peer to peer (using 
        <a href="www.pearjs.com">PeerJS</a>) and call/flip the coin securely without the use of a central server.</p>
