AcheyNet
========

I always learn new technologies best through small projects.  With that in mind I’ve started a new projects site at <a href="http://AcheyNet.AzureWebsites.Net" target="_blank">http://AcheyNet.AzureWebsites.Net</a> hosted in Windows Azure.  All source code will be publicly hosted through my Github account from which the site is directly deployed.

I intend to use this as a portfolio page to showcase some of the things I’ve been experimenting with lately.  Feedback is very welcome.
